//! `nxb build`: the NSP build script (`scripts/build_ipa_from_nsp.py`) as one stage graph. Same command line (the
//! options it does not implement yet are refused by name, exit code 1 with a `[RED]` line), same console events
//! (`--progress json`: the front ends' NDJSON, [`events`]), same exit codes (0 done, 1 error, 2 bad arguments, 130
//! interrupted).
//!
//! The graph (`--platform mac-app`): extract + split (fused, one pass for all versions) -> shaders -> pipeline archive
//! (when `--gpu` names an architecture.`nxb-archive`, not run on a full game from here yet) -> app (stage + sign, an in-place update of the previous app).
//! Stages overlap where the graph allows ([`order`]): the Mac host from the start, the app's companion app, icon and
//! settings beside the shader step, the first archive's batches as their libraries appear (widening to every core when
//! the shader step ends), the console events stay those of a run one after another. Not overlapped yet: the shader
//! step with the extract (it reads the split's packages when they are all written) and the staging of the app's
//! non-shader files with the shader step. `--dry-run` prints the graph and the keys.
//!
//! `--platform mac` has the same nodes without the app and ends with the command that runs the game (`mac_run`).
//! `--program N` builds one program of a multi-program application as a game of its own. For `mac-app` and `mac`, the
//! profile's other programs are built that way first (`programs`).
//!
//! The rewrite (`patch_nso.py`) is made by [`rewrite`] when the work folder has no `patched_<package>`, with the engine's own
//! files (a case outside the port's contract stops the build at the rewrite with the message of `nxb rewrite`, which exits with code 4: there is no fallback to a later stage without the patched modules). Not ported yet,
//! taken from the work folder (the Python build's outputs) and named in the plan: the survey and profile steps. The
//! shader step is an existing library folder (`--shaders`, or the work folder's `shader/cache/b-<chain>`), running the
//! lead's `shaderbuild build` as a process from here is not wired yet.
