//! The title module of The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time for Nintendo Switch 2 (`0400486024DEC000`).
//!
//! The game runs on Nintendo EPD's engine (family `agl`) on NVN2. What every game of that engine shares is in the
//! family. This module holds what is known to be true for this game. `render_cond`, `tex_flush_upload` and
//! `tex_dirty_upload` come from agl code, but Breath of the Wild does not set them, so they are here.
//!
//! The upscaler choice and the frame pacing have no answer yet, so the core defaults apply. The seed list for the
//! prepare step is `pso_manifest.tsv` in `seedds/nxnative` `dm/games/0400486024DEC000/`.
