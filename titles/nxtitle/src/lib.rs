//! The title layer: a core, engine families and title modules.
//!
//! - The core is the rest of the workspace. It knows no title and no engine.
//! - A family ([`Family`]) holds what is true for every game of one engine, for example sead, agl and gsys.
//! - A title module ([`Title`]) holds what is true for one game only.
//!
//! Families and titles answer questions through hooks ([`BuildHooks`], [`RuntimeHooks`]). Every answer is a
//! [`Fact`], a value with its [`Evidence`]. `None` means "no opinion", and the question goes one layer down:
//! title, then family, then the core default. A title names its family by id, as data. It does not depend on the
//! family crate, so either can be built and tested alone.
//!
//! The [`Catalog`] composes families and titles for one game ([`Catalog::resolve`]). The crate `nxtitles` builds
//! the catalog from the modules that are switched on by cargo features. The core uses this crate and the catalog
//! only, never a family or title crate.
//!
//! nxnative runs every [`Service`] of a game by default. A family or title moves a service to nxkit through
//! [`RuntimeHooks::runtime`], so nxkit replaces nxnative one service at a time.
//!
//! A title module does not work around a core bug. A fix that helps more than one game belongs in the core.
